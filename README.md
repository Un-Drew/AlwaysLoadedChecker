# Welcome to the A Hat in Time Always Loaded Checker

**"Crashes and bugs may be pain, but itâ€™s AlwaysLoaded that will drive you insane!"** *-Someone*

This is an unofficial tool that lets you easily check whether a class is AlwaysLoaded or not!

Additionally, the tool can also dump the AlwaysLoaded-ness of all classes into a text file:

# Installing & Requirements
1. Have the game installed, of course.
2. Make sure you have the [.NET Framework 4.8 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) installed. (If you already have the modding tools, then you definitely have this installed, too)
3. Download and extract the latest version of this tool from the [Releases](https://github.com/Un-Drew/AlwaysLoadedChecker/releases).
4. Download and extract Glidor's [Unreal Package Decompressor](https://www.gildor.org/downloads), then place the extracted **decompress.exe** in the tool's folder. This is necessary, as the tool needs to be able to extract the game's pacakges.

...And you're all set!
