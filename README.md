# Welcome to the A Hat in Time Always Loaded Checker

**"Crashes and bugs may be pain, but itâ€™s AlwaysLoaded that will drive you insane!"** *-Someone*

This is an unofficial tool that lets you easily check whether a class is AlwaysLoaded or not!

Additionally, the tool can also dump the AlwaysLoaded-ness of all classes into a text file:

# How to install
1. Download and extract the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/Un-Drew/AlwaysLoadedChecker/releases).
2. Download and extract Glidor's [Unreal Package Decompressor](https://www.gildor.org/downloads), then place the extracted **decompress.exe** in the tool's folder. This is necessary, as the tool needs to be able to extract the game's pacakges.
